        {agent_descriptions}

        Here are some examples of planning:

        Example 1:
        Task:
        Move all objects from sofa to bedroom

        House description:
        living_room_0: chair_0, chair_1, chair_2, chair_3, table_0, couch_0, couch_1, table_1, table_2, table_3
        closet_0: shelves_0
        bedroom_0: bed_0, chest_of_drawers_0, chest_of_drawers_1
        kitchen_1: cabinet_0, table_4, chair_4, chair_5, chair_6, chair_7
        bedroom_1: bed_1, chest_of_drawers_2, chest_of_drawers_3
        bedroom_2: bed_2, chest_of_drawers_4, chest_of_drawers_5, wardrobe_0, wardrobe_1
        laundryroom/mudroom_0: washer_dryer_0, washer_dryer_1, shelves_1, shelves_2
        bathroom_0: toilet_0
        bathroom_2: toilet_1
        bathroom_1: toilet_2
        kitchen_0: fridge_0
        garage_0: fridge_1

        Objects in the house:
        cherry_0: couch_0
        banana_0: couch_1
        apple_0: table_4
        toy_fire_truck_0: bed_0

        Thought: Based on the task and the list of objects in the house, the task-relevant objects are cherry_0 and banana_0, located on the couch_0 and couch_1 in the living room. The desired location for these objects is the bedroom. Since there are multiple bedrooms, I will pick one of them. I will now ask each agent to rearrange these objects.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[cherry_0, bedroom_0]
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[banana_0, bedroom_0]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: Successful execution!
        Agent_1_Observation: Action "Rearrange[banana_0, bedroom_0]" is still in progress.
        Thought: Agent 0 successfully transferred the target. Agent 1 is still executing the previous action, so I will reassign the same action to it and ask Agent 0 to wait.
        Agent_0_Action: Wait[]
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[banana_0, bedroom_0]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: Wait[]
        Agent_1_Observation: Successful execution!
        Thought: All objects were successfully moved, so I am done!
        Final Thought: Exit!

        Example 2:
        Task:
        Move pillow to bed and then move apple to kitchen counter.

        House description:
        living_room_0: table_0, couch_0, chair_2, shelves_1, chair_5, chair_6, table_7, chair_7, chair_8, chair_9, chair_10, chair_11, chair_12, table_9, table_10, stand_0, chest_of_drawers_2
        laundryroom/mudroom_0: washer_dryer_0, washer_dryer_1, shelves_0
        bathroom_1: bathtub_0, table_11
        bedroom_1: table_1, chair_1, bed_0, table_4, table_5, chair_4, stool_0, bench_0, table_12, chest_of_drawers_3
        kitchen_0: cabinet_0, cabinet_1, cabinet_2, counter_0, chair_2, cabinet_3, cabinet_4, cabinet_5, chair_13, chair_14, chair_15, counter_1, cabinet_6, fridge_0, cabinet_7, cabinet_8
        bedroom_0: chair_0, table_2, table_3, bed_1, bench_2, chest_of_drawers_0, chest_of_drawers_1
        bathroom_0: chair_3, table_8, bench_1
        hallway_0: table_6
        entryway/foyer/lobby_0: bench_3

        Objects in the house:
        pillow_0: couch_0
        pillow_1: couch_0
        apple_0: chair_2
        pen_0: table_6
        laptop_0: table_1

        Thought: Based on the task and the list of objects in the house, the task-relevant objects are pillow_0, pillow_1 and apple_0, located on the couch_0, couch_0, and chair_2 respectively. The task requires moving pillows first to the desired location of bed in bedroom. Since there are multiple beds, I will pick one of them. I will now ask each agent to rearrange these objects.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[pillow_0, bed_0]
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[pillow_1, bed_0]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: Action "Rearrange[pillow_0, bed_0]" is still in progress.
        Agent_1_Observation: Successful execution!
        Thought: Agent 1 successfully transferred the target. Agent 0 is still executing the previous action, so I will reassign the same action to it and ask Agent 1 to wait.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[pillow_0, bed_0]
        Agent_1_Action: Wait[]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: Successful execution!
        Agent_1_Observation: Wait[]
        Thought: Now that both pillows have been successfully moved, I will move on to the next part of the task. I should ask one of the agents to rearrange the apple now to the desired location of counter in the kitchen. Since there are multiple counters in the kitchen, I will pick any one of them.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[apple_0, counter_0]
        Agent_1_Action: Wait[]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: Successful execution!
        Agent_1_Observation: Wait[]
        Thought: All objects were successfully moved, so I am done!
        Final Thought: Exit!

        Strictly follow the above format while solving given task.

        Task:
        {input}

        House description:
        {house_description}

        Objects in the house:
        {all_objects}

        Thought:

# This is crucial, it's when the LLM stops generating text and waits for the
# environment to respond
stopword       : "Assigned!"

# End of the interaction.
end_expression : "Final Thought:"

# The parser is a function that maps LLM output to a tuple of (agent, action, action_input)
actions_parser:
  _target_     : habitat_llm.llm.instruct.utils.actions_parser

  # It's a function so we do partial initialization
  _partial_    : true
