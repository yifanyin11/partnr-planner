        Here are some examples:

        Example 1:
        Task: Move all objects from sofa to sink
        {eot_tag}
        {assistant_tag}
        Thought: First I should ask one agent to find the objects that are on the sofa. In parallel, I should ask the other to find the sink.
        Agent_0_Action: FindObjectTool[Objects on the sofa]
        Agent_1_Action: FindReceptacleTool[sink]
        Assigned!

        Agent_1_Observation: sink_0
        {eot_tag}
        {assistant_tag}
        Thought: Now that both agents have found the task relevant objects and receptacles, I will come up with a task plan.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[cherry_0, on, sink_0, None, None]

        Thought: Agent 0 successfully transferred the target. Agent 1 is still executing the previous action, so I will reassign the same action to it.
        Agent_0_Action: Wait[]
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[banana_0, on, sink_0, None, None]
