        - Overview:
        Your goal is to find the optimal next action for an agent collaborating with another agent in a multi-agent planning task. Find action for the agent as best as you can. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. Below is the detailed description of different actions that the agent can use for solving the task. You can assign them to Agent_{id} as required. Remember to assign only 1 action to your agent. There will be another agent working in the same house trying to acomplish the same task. Your role is to enable Agent_{id} to finish the task together by collaborating with its partner agent.

        You should account for the task progress, locations of objects in the house, the partner agent's state, and your agent's observations to determine the next optimal action for your agent. The optimal action should be aimed at enabling faster and more efficient task completion. So avoid doing tasks that the partner agent is doing and instead focus on tasks that are left over and can be done in parallel.

        Here are some examples of allocating optimal next actions to your agent in a given task:

        Example 1:
        Task:
        Move all objects from sofa to bedroom and place them next to the toy truck.

        House description:
        living_room_0: chair_0, chair_1, chair_2, chair_3, table_0, couch_0, couch_1, table_1, table_2, table_3
        closet_0: shelves_0
        bedroom_0: bed_0, chest_of_drawers_0, chest_of_drawers_1
        kitchen_1: cabinet_0, table_4, chair_4, chair_5, chair_6, chair_7
        bedroom_1: bed_1, chest_of_drawers_2, chest_of_drawers_3
        bedroom_2: bed_2, chest_of_drawers_4, chest_of_drawers_5, wardrobe_0, wardrobe_1
        laundryroom/mudroom_0: washer_dryer_0, washer_dryer_1, shelves_1, shelves_2
        bathroom_0: toilet_0
        bathroom_2: toilet_1
        bathroom_1: toilet_2
        kitchen_0: fridge_0
        garage_0: fridge_1

        Objects found in the house so far:
        cherry_0: couch_0
        apple_0: couch_0
        banana_0: couch_0

        Task progress:
        Agent 0 is walking.
        Agent 1 is waiting and ready to start collaborating.

        Your agent's observations of the last executed action (if available):

        {eot_tag}

        {assistant_tag}
        Thought: Based on the task and the list of objects in the house, the current task-relevant objects are cherry_0, banana_0, apple_0 located on the couch_0, couch_0, and couch_0 respectively. The desired location for these objects is the bedroom, specifically next to the toy truck based on the task description. So I will choose the bed where toy truck is located as target location for these objects. However, it is unclear which bed is the toy truck on. So I will ask my agent to explore each bedroom with names bedroom_0, bedroom_1, and bedroom_2 in the house one by one. I will assign the "explore" action to the agent using the exact names of the rooms to prevent any confusion for the agent.
        Agent_0_Action: Explore[bedroom_0]
        Assigned!

        Task progress:
        Agent 0 moved the pillow_0 from chair to bed_0 and is currently carrying rearranging pillow_1.
        Agent 1 is currently waiting.

        Your agent's observations of the last executed action (if available):
        Agent_0_observation: Action Rearrange[pillow_1, on, bed_0, None, None] is still in progress.
        {eot_tag}

        {assistant_tag}
        Thought: Based on the task and the list of objects in the house, the task-relevant objects are pillow_0 and pillow_1 located on bed_0 and agent_0 respectively and apple, whose location is unknown. The task requires moving pillows first to the desired location of bed in bedroom. Since pillow_0 is already on bed_0, I will focus on pillow_1 and searching for apple. Since Agent 0 is still rearranging the pillow_1 to the bed_0, which needs to be rearranged before rearranging apple, I will let Agent 0 finish this part of the task. So, I will reassign rearange pillow_1 action back to Agent 0.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[pillow_1, on, bed_0, None, None]

All agents have finished successful execution. Since the task is to move all towels to the bathroom and all towels are in the bathroom already and no towels are in the kitchen, the task is complete.

        Your agent's observations of the last executed action (if available):
        Agent_0_Observation: Node with name living room not present in the graph. The entity name may be wrong or the entity may not exist in the house. Use entity names that match with the names of rooms and furniture provided in the house description.
        {eot_tag}

        {assistant_tag}
        Thought: Based on the task and the list of objects in the house, the task-relevant objects are stuffed toy and book. The task requires moving them to the desired location of shelves either in the living room or the laundryroom. Since it is unclear where stuffed toy and book are in the house, I will first ask my agent 0 to search the rooms in the house that are likely to have stuffed toy and book. From the house description, living room and bedroom are likely to have these objects. So, I will ask my agent 0 to explore the living room. Based on my agent's previous observation, it looks like the living room name used with the agent's previous action did not match the house description. So I will use the EXACT name of the living room provided in the house description when I assign action to my agent.

Since the laptop and pen need to be placed next to each other and Agent 1 hasn't started the task yet, I will wait for the agent 1 to place one of them on the bed first and ask my agent 0 to wait.

        - Overview:
        You are a task-summarizer. You are thus an expert in summarizing agent activities towards accomplishing a desired task based on the provided history of the agent actions.

        Given a sequence of actions representing the previous states/actions of two agents, summarize the overall activity performed by both the agents in a SINGLE sentence. The summary should be coherent and concise. The agent previous actions may include "standing," "walking," "picking up <object>," "placing on <location>, opening <object>, closing <object>, waiting" etc. Your goal is to generate a summary sentence that captures the progress the agents have made in accomplishing a given task. Use only past tense to represent task progress.

        Ensure that the summary is grammatically correct, concise i.e., a single sentence, and logically coherent. The summary should strictly be task-relevant and based on the sequence of actions of the agents and provided task description.
