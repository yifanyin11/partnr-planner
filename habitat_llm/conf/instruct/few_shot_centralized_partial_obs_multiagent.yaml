        Here are some examples:

        Example 1:
        Task: Move all objects from sofa to sink
        Thought: First I should ask one agent to find the objects that are on the sofa. In parallel, I should ask the other to find the sink.
        Agent_0_Action: FindObjectTool[Objects on the sofa]
        Agent_1_Action: FindReceptacleTool[sink]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: - cherry_0 in Sofa
        - banana_0 in Sofa
        Agent_1_Observation: sink_0
        Thought: Now that both agents have found the task relevant objects and receptacles, I will come up with a task plan.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[cherry_0, sink_0]
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[banana_0, sink_0]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: Successful execution!
        Agent_1_Observation: Action "Rearrange[banana_0, sink_0]" is still in progress.
        Thought: Agent 0 successfully transferred the target. Agent 1 is still executing the previous action, so I will reassign the same action to it.
        Agent_0_Action: Wait[]
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[banana_0, sink_0]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: Waiting
        Agent_1_Observation: Successful execution!
        Thought: All objects were successfully moved, so I am done!
        Final Thought: Exit!

        Example 2:
        Task: Move pillow to bed and then move apple to kitchen counter
        Thought: First I should ask one agent to find the pillow. In parallel, I should ask the other to find bed.

        Agent_0_Observation: - pillow_0 in sofa
        - pillow_1 in couch
        Agent_1_Observation: bed_0, bed_1
        Thought: Now that both agents have found the task relevant objects and receptacles, I will come up with a task plan. Since there are many beds, I will pick any one of them.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[pillow_0, bed_0]
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[pillow_1, bed_0]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: Successful execution!
        Agent_1_Observation: Action "Rearrange[pillow_1, bed_0]" is still in progress.
        Thought: Agent 0 successfully transferred the target. Agent 1 is still executing the previous action, so I will reassign the same action to it.
        Agent_0_Action: Wait[]
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[pillow_1, bed_0]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: Waiting
        Agent_1_Observation: Successful execution!
        Thought: Now that both pillows have been successfully moved, I will move on to the next part of the task. I should ask one agent to find the apple. In parallel, I should ask the other to find kitchen counter.
        Agent_0_Action: FindObjectTool[apple]
        Agent_1_Action: FindReceptacleTool[kitchen counter]
        Assigned!
        Agent_0_Observation: - apple_0 in sofa
        Agent_1_Observation: counter_0, counter_1, counter_2 are in kitchen
        Thought: Now that both agents have found the task relevant objects and receptacles, I will come up with a task plan. Since there are multiple counters in kitchen, I will pick any one of them.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[apple_0, counter_0]
        Agent_1_Action: Wait[]
        Assigned!

        Example 3:
        Task: Move basket to the chair in living room

        Agent_1_Observation: chair_0, chair_1, chair_2, chair_3 found in living room.
        Thought: Agent_0 was not able to find the object, this means I need to search
        the house to find basket object. I will search the house by navigating to receptacles which may contain the object.

        Agent_1_Action: Wait[]

        agents to navigate to those receptacles to explore in parallel.
        find the basket object.
        Agent_0_Action: Navigate[sofa_0]
        Agent_1_Action: Navigate[bench_35]

        Asgent_1_Observation: Successful execution!
        Thought: Agent_0 has found the basket object. Now that I have all the objects, I
        will start the task planning. Agent_1 found multiple chairs in previous step, so I will pick any one of
        them to ground the rearrangement task.
        Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[basket_2, chair_0]
        Agent_1_Action: Wait[]

        Strictly follow the above format while solving given task.

        Task: {input}
        Thought:

# This is crucial, it's when the LLM stops generating text and waits for the
# environment to respond
stopword       : "Assigned!"

# End of the interaction.
end_expression : "Final Thought:"

# The parser is a function that maps LLM output to a tuple of (agent, action, action_input)
actions_parser:
  _target_     : habitat_llm.llm.instruct.utils.actions_parser

  # It's a function so we do partial initialization
  _partial_    : true
