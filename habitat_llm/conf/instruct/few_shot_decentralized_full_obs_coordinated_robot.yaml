        {agent_descriptions}

        Here are some examples:

        Example 1:
        Task: Move all objects from sofa to sink
        Thought: First I should ask the agent to find the objects that are on the sofa.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindObjectTool[Objects on the sofa]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_observation: - cherry_0 in Sofa
        - banana_0 in Sofa
        Thought: Now that the agent has found task relevant objects, I will ask it to find task relevant target receptacles.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindReceptacleTool[sink]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_observation: sink_0
        Thought: Now that both task relevant objects and receptacles have been found, I will enquire the actions of the other agent.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindAgentActionTool[]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_Observation: The agent walked to cherry_0, picked it and placed it on sink_0, and now is standing.
        Thought: Since the other agent already moved the cherry_0, I will do the remaining parts of the task.
        Agent_{id}_Action: Rearrange[banana_0, on, sink_0, None, None]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_Observation: Successful execution!
        Thought: Assuming that the other agent finished its actions, all objects were successfully moved, so I am done!
        Final Thought: Exit!

        Example 2:
        Task: Move pillow to bed and then move apple to kitchen counter
        Thought: First I should ask the agent to find the pillow.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindObjectTool[pillow]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_observation: - pillow_0 in sofa
        - pillow_1 in couch
        Thought: Now that the agent has found task relevant objects, I will ask it to find task relevant target receptacles.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindReceptacleTool[bed]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_observation: bed_0, bed_1
        Thought: Now that both task relevant objects and receptacles have been found, I will enquire the actions of the other agent.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindAgentActionTool[]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_Observation: The agent is holding pillow_0 and moving.
        Thought: Since the other agent seems to be helping with moving pillow_0, I will do the remaining parts of the task. Since there are multiple beds, I will pick any one of them.
        Agent_{id}_Action: Rearrange[pillow_1, on, bed_0, None, None]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_Observation: Successful execution!
        Thought: Agent successfully transferred the target. I will check the actions of the other agent.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindAgentActionTool[]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_Observation: Agent moved pillow_0 to bed_0 and now is walking with apple_0.
        Thought: Other agent has already moved the pillow and now seems to be moving apple_0. Assuming that the other agent finishes its actions, all objects would be successfully moved, so I am done!
        Final Thought: Exit!

        Example 3:
        Task: Move bowl, cup and basket to the chair in living room
        Thought: First I should ask the agent to find the bowl, cup and basket
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindObjectTool[bowl, cup, basket]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_observation: - bowl_0 on Sofa
        - cup_1 on Sofa
        - basket_2 on Sofa
        Thought: Now that the agent has found task relevant objects, I will ask it to find task relevant target receptacles.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindReceptacleTool[chair in living room]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_observation: chair_0, chair_1, chair_2, chair_3 found in living room.
        Thought: Now that both task relevant objects and receptacles have been found, I will find the actions of the other agent.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindAgentActionTool[]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_Observation: Agent is walking.
        Thought: Since the other agent is walking, I will assume that it is trying to move bowl_0. I will do the next part of the task. Since there are many chairs, I will pick any one of them.
        Agent_{id}_Action: Rearrange[cup_1, on, chair_0, None, None]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_Observation: Successful execution!
        Thought: Agent successfully transferred the target. So I will check again the actions of the other agent.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindAgentActionTool[]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_Observation: Agent is holding bowl_0 and walking.
        Thought: Since the other agent is still seems to be moving bowl_0, I will proceed to the next parts of the task.
        Agent_{id}_Action: Rearrange[basket_2, on, chair_0, None, None]
        Assigned!
        Agent_{id}_Observation: Successful execution!
        Thought: Assuming that the other agent finished its actions, all objects were successfully moved, so I am done!
        Final Thought: Exit!

        Task: {input}
        Thought:

# This is crucial, it's when the LLM stops generating text and waits for the
# environment to respond
stopword       : "Assigned!"

# End of the interaction.
end_expression : "Final Thought:"

# The parser is a function that maps LLM output to a tuple of (agent, action, action_input)

  # It's a function so we do partial initialization
