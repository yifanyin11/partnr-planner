        - Overview:
        Your goal is to find the optimal next action for an agent collaborating with another agent in a multi-agent planning task. Find action for the agent as best as you can. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. Below is the detailed description of different actions that the agent can use for solving the task. You can assign them to Agent_{id} as required. Remember to assign only 1 action to your agent. There will be another agent working in the same house trying to acomplish the same task. Your role is to enable Agent_{id} to finish the task together by collaborating with its partner agent.

        You should account for the task progress, locations of objects in the house, the partner agent's state, and your agent's observations to determine the next optimal action for your agent. The optimal action should be aimed at enabling faster and more efficient task completion. So avoid doing tasks that the partner agent is doing and instead focus on tasks that are left over and can be done in parallel.

        {tool_descriptions}


        Here are some examples of allocating optimal next actions to the agents in a given task:

        Example 1:
        Task:
        Move all objects from sofa to bedroom and place them next to the toy truck.

        House description:
        living_room_0: chair_0, chair_1, chair_2, chair_3, table_0, couch_0, couch_1, table_1, table_2, table_3
        closet_0: shelves_0
        bedroom_0: bed_0, chest_of_drawers_0, chest_of_drawers_1
        kitchen_1: cabinet_0, table_4, chair_4, chair_5, chair_6, chair_7
        bedroom_1: bed_1, chest_of_drawers_2, chest_of_drawers_3
        bedroom_2: bed_2, chest_of_drawers_4, chest_of_drawers_5, wardrobe_0, wardrobe_1
        laundryroom/mudroom_0: washer_dryer_0, washer_dryer_1, shelves_1, shelves_2
        bathroom_0: toilet_0
        bathroom_2: toilet_1
        bathroom_1: toilet_2
        kitchen_0: fridge_0
        garage_0: fridge_1

        Objects in the house:
        cherry_0: couch_0
        apple_0: agent_1
        banana_0: couch_0
        toy_fire_truck_0: bed_1

        Task progress:
        Agent 0 is waiting and ready to start collaborating.
        Agent 1 is holding apple_0 and walking.

        Your agent's observations of the last executed action (if available):
        Agent_1_observation: Action Rearrange[apple_0, on, bed_1, next_to, toy_fire_truck_0] is still in progress.

        Thought: Based on the task and the list of objects in the house, the current task-relevant objects are cherry_0, banana_0, apple_0 located on the couch_0, couch_0, and agent_1 respectively. The desired location for these objects is the bedroom, specifically next to the toy truck based on the task description. So I will choose the bed where toy truck is located as target location for these objects. Since Agent 1 is still rearranging apple_0, I will reassign this action back to Agent 1.
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[apple_0, on, bed_1, next_to, toy_fire_truck_0]
        Assigned!


        Example 2:
        Task:
        Move pillow to bed and then move apple to kitchen counter.

        House description:
        living_room_0: table_0, couch_0, chair_2, shelves_1, chair_5, chair_6, table_7, chair_7, chair_8, chair_9, chair_10, chair_11, chair_12, table_9, table_10, stand_0, chest_of_drawers_2
        laundryroom/mudroom_0: washer_dryer_0, washer_dryer_1, shelves_0
        bathroom_1: bathtub_0, table_11
        bedroom_1: table_1, chair_1, bed_0, table_4, table_5, chair_4, stool_0, bench_0, table_12, chest_of_drawers_3

        pillow_1: couch_0
        apple_0: chair_2
        pen_0: table_6
        laptop_0: table_1

        Task progress:
        Agent 0 moved the pillow_0 from chair to bed_0.
        Agent 1 is currently waiting.

        Your agent's observations of the last executed action (if available):

        Thought: Based on the task and the list of objects in the house, the task-relevant objects are pillow_0, pillow_1 and apple_0, located on bed_0, agent_0 and chair_2 respectively. The task requires moving pillows first to the desired location of bed in bedroom. Since pillow_0 is already on bed_0, I will focus on pillow_1 and apple_0. Since the pillow_1 needs to be rearranged before moving apple, I will ask Agent 1 to rearrange pillow_1 first.
        Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[pillow_1, on, bed_0, None, None]
        Assigned!


        Example 3:
        Task:

        sponge_0: chair_2
        pen_0: table_0
        stuffed_toy_0: table_1

        Task progress:
        Agent 0 moved the hand_towel_0 from chair to table_2. Agent 0 moved bath_towel_0 to table_2.
        Agent 1 moved the hand_towel_1 to the bathroom_0.

        Your agent's observations of the last executed action (if available):
        Agent_1_observation: Successful execution!

        Thought: Based on the task and the list of objects in the house, the task-relevant objects are hand_towel_0, hand_towel_1 and bath_towel_0, located on table_2, bathroom_0 and table_2 respectively. All agents have finished successful execution. Since the task is to move all towels to the bathroom and all towels are in the bathroom already based on the task progress, the task is complete.
        Final Thought: Exit!
        Assigned!

        Example 4:
        Task:
        Move pillow to bed and then move apple to next to the pillows.

        Task progress:
        Agent 0 moved the pillow_0 from chair to bed_0 and is currently moving with pillow_1
        Agent 1 is currently waiting.

        Your agent's observations of the last executed action (if available):

        Thought: Based on the task and the list of objects in the house, the task-relevant objects are pillow_0, pillow_1 and apple_0, located on bed_0, agent_0 and chair_2 respectively. The task requires moving pillows first to the desired location of bed in bedroom. Since pillow_0 is already on bed_0, I will focus on pillow_1 and apple_0. Since the pillow_1 needs to be rearranged before moving apple and agent_0 is already moving with pillow_1 presumably to place it at its designated location, I will ask my agent 1 to wait for this part of the task to be done before rearranging apple.

prompt_summarizer: |-
        - Overview:
        You are an expert in summarizing agent activities towards accomplishing a desired task based on the provided history of the agent's actions. Given a sequence of actions representing the states/actions of two agents, summarize the overall activity performed by both the agents in a coherent and concise manner. The agent actions may include "standing," "walking," "picking up <object>," "placing on <location>, opening <object>, closing <object>, waiting" etc.

        Your task is to generate a summary sentence that captures the essence of the activities of two agents.

        Example 1:
        Task: Put the apple in the cabinet. Then, place bottle in the fridge.

        Agent_0_History: standing, walking, waiting.
        Agent_1_History: walking, picking up apple_0, walking, opening cabinet_0, placing apple_0 in cabinet_0.

        Task progress summary:
        Agent 0: Agent 0 was moving but is currently waiting.
        Agent 1: Agent 0 picked an apple and placed it in cabinet_0.
        Done!

        Example 2:
        Task: Put all toys in the bedroom.

        Agent_0_History: standing, walking, picking up toy_vehicle_0, walking, placing toy_vehicle_0 on bed_0, walking.
        Agent_1_History: standing, walking, picking up toy_fruits_0, walking, placing toy_fruits_0 on bed_0, walking, picking up toy_animal_1, walking.

        Task progress summary:
        Agent 0: Agent 0 moved toy_vehicle_0 to bed_0 and currently walking somewhere.
        Agent 1: Agent 1 moved toy_fruits_0 to bed_0. Agent 1 is currently holding toy_animal_1 and walking somewhere to place it.
        Done!

        Example 3:
        Task: Put picture frame and spectacles on the table in bedroom.

        Agent_0_History: Idle.
        Agent_1_History: Idle.

        Task progress summary:
        Agent 0: Agent 0 is waiting and ready to start collaborating.
        Agent 1: Agent 1 is waiting and ready to start collaborating.
        Done!


        Ensure that the summary is grammatically correct, logically coherent, and task-relevant based on the sequence of actions of the agents and provided task description.

        Task: {input}
        Agent_0_History: {agent0_actions}
        Agent_1_History: {agent1_actions}
