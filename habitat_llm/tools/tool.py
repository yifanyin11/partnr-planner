"""
An abstract class for tools. A tool is a callable object that takes a dictionary
of inputs and returns a dictionary of outputs. The inputs and outputs are specified
by the attributes "input_keys" and "output_keys", respectively. The tool also has
a description and a name.

Examples of tools include low-level actions to the environment, perception
tools, and language generation tools. The requirement is that the inputs and
outputs are in LANGUAGE so that it can be sent to the LLM.

    trying to test the perception tools in isolation or when you want to test the
