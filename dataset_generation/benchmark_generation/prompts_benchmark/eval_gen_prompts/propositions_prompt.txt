You will be given an instruction describing a household task and a description of the initial state of the house. You will define a list of python functions that must be satisfied for the task to be marked complete.

You can call the following functions:
- is_on_top(object_names: str, furniture_name: str)  # any object in object_names is on top of a furniture
- is_inside(object_names: str, furniture_name: str)  # any object in object_names is inside of a furniture
- is_in_room(object_names: str, room_name: str)      # any object in object_names is in a room
- is_on_floor(object_names: str)                     # any object in object_names is on the floor
- is_next_to(objects_a: str, objects_b: str)         # any object in objects_a is next to any object in objects_b
- is_clean(object_names: str)                        # any object in object_names is clean
- is_dirty(object_names: str)                        # any object in object_names is dirty
- is_filled(object_names: str)                       # any object in object_names is filled, like with a liquid
- is_empty(object_names: str)                        # any object in object_names is empty
- is_powered_on(object_names: str)                   # any object in object_names is powered on
- is_powered_off(object_names: str)                  # any object in object_names is powered off

Objects in object_names can be expressed as it appears in the objects list ("stuffed_toy_1") or as an OR of object names ("stuffed_toy_1 or stuffed_toy_2").
A furniture_name can be expressed as it appears in the furniture list (e.g. "table") or as it appears in the furniture-room relation ("table in living_room").

Only use the functions listed above.
Each function should test a single objects/furniture/room relation.
If the instruction is ambiguous such that multiple objects could be used to satisfy a function (an OR relationship), then include all possible objects.
Define as many functions as necessary.
Write each function on its own line.
It is essential to wrap each function in delimiters [FN] and [/FN].
End your functions with the token [END].

Let's see some examples. Suppose the initial state is:

Objects:
    * pants_1
    * shirt_1
    * shirt_2
    * shirt_3
Furniture:
    * washer_dryer
    * table
Rooms:
    * laundryroom
Object-Furniture-Room Relations:
    * pants_1 on table in laundryroom
    * shirt_1 on table in laundryroom
    * shirt_2 on floor in laundryroom
Furniture-Room Relations:
    * washer_dryer in laundryroom
    * table in laundryroom

Instruction "Put the pants on the table" means

    [FN] is_on_top("pants_1", "table in laundryroom") [/FN]

Instruction "Put the pants in the washer" means

    [FN] is_inside("pants_1", "washer_dryer in laundryroom") [/FN]

    [FN] is_inside("shirt_2", "washer_dryer in laundryroom") [/FN]
    [FN] is_inside("shirt_3", "washer_dryer in laundryroom") [/FN]

Instruction "Put a shirt on the floor next to the pants" means

    [FN] is_on_floor("shirt_1 or shirt_2 or shirt_3") [/FN]
    [FN] is_next_to("shirt_1 or shirt_2 or shirt_3", "pants_1") [/FN]

Instruction "Bring a shirt to the laundryroom" means
