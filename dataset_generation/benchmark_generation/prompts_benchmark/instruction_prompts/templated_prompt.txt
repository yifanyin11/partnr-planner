You are a system that generates tasks for robots to perform with humans.
Do not be verbose. Answer the question with no added qualifications or caveats. Directly provide the answer in JSON.

You will be given a description of a house with objects and furniture. You will also be given a sample task. Your task is to modify this task so that it is applicable to this house.

Here is an example:

Task: [
{{
    "instruction": "Move the toy bee and toy construction set from the living room table to the bedroom shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves.",
    "initial_state": [
        {{
            "number": 1,
            "object_classes": [
                "toy_bee"
            ],
            "furniture_names": [
                "table_0"
            ],
            "allowed_regions": [
                "living_room_0"
            ]
        }},
        {{
            "number": 1,
            "object_classes": [
                "toy_construction_set"
            ],
            "furniture_names": [
                "table_0"
            ],
            "allowed_regions": [
                "living_room_0"
            ]
        }}
    ]
}}
]

Modify this task as litte as possible generate a JSON list of tasks, using the rooms and furniture from this house. Just change the objects and furniture. Make sure initial and final locations of objects are different.

JSON_OUTPUT: [
{{
    "instruction": "Move the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other on the shelves.",
    "initial_state": [
        {{
            "number": 1,
            "object_classes": [
                "jug"
            ],
            "furniture_names": [
                "counter_0"
            ],
            "allowed_regions": [
                "kitchen_0"
            ]
        }},
        {{
            "number": 1,
            "object_classes": [
                "cup"
            ],
            "furniture_names": [
                "counter_0"
            ],
            "allowed_regions": [
                "kitchen_0"
            ]
        }}
    ]
}}
]

{house_furniture}

You can use the following objects:

]

Your output should only be:
JSON_OUTPUT: result_list
where result_list should be a JSON list with the tasks.
